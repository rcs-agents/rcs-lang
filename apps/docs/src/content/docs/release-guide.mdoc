# Release Guide

This guide explains how to create releases and publish packages for the RCL monorepo.

## Overview

The RCL project uses a **release branch workflow**:

- **Development** happens on `main` branch
- **Releases** are triggered by pushing to `release` branch
- **Tags** are automatically synced back to `main`

## Release Workflow

### How it Works

1. **Develop on main branch** using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat:` - New features (bumps minor version)
   - `fix:` - Bug fixes (bumps patch version) 
   - `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` - Breaking changes (bumps major version)
   - `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`, etc. - Non-release changes

2. **Update version** in package.json files when ready to release:
   ```bash
   # Update version in root package.json and all packages
   bun run version:bump patch  # or minor, major
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.0.1"
   ```

3. **Push to release branch** to trigger automatic:
   - GitHub release creation with changelog
   - NPM package publishing
   - VSCode extension publishing
   - Tag creation and sync to main

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Develop features on main
git checkout main
git add .
git commit -m "feat(compiler): add support for async actions"
git push origin main

# When ready to release (one command!)
bun run release:minor

# This single command will:
# 1. Ensure you're on main branch
# 2. Pull latest changes
# 3. Bump version to next minor (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
# 4. Create release commit
# 5. Push to release branch
# 6. Trigger automatic release workflow

# The GitHub Actions workflow then:
# 1. Builds and tests everything
# 2. Creates a v1.1.0 tag
# 3. Creates GitHub release with changelog
# 4. Publishes NPM packages
# 5. Publishes VSCode extension
# 6. Syncs the tag back to main
```

### Quick Release Commands

```bash
# Patch release (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
bun run release:patch

# Minor release (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
bun run release:minor

# Major release (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
bun run release:major

# Dry run (see what would happen)
bun run release:dry
```

### Commit Message Examples

```bash
# Feature (minor version bump)
feat(parser): add support for nested flows
feat(cli): add --watch flag for development

# Bug fix (patch version bump)
fix(compiler): resolve state transition validation
fix(extension): fix syntax highlighting for strings

# Breaking change (major version bump)
feat(ast)!: change AST node structure for flows
fix(compiler)!: require explicit state declarations

# Multiple packages
feat: update parser and compiler for new syntax
```

## Alternative: Manual Releases

The manual workflow is available for special cases:
- Emergency patches
- Pre-releases/beta versions
- Testing release process

### Steps

1. Go to GitHub Actions → "Manual Release & Publish"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select:
   - **Release type**: patch, minor, or major
   - **Prerelease**: true for beta releases
   - **Packages**: "all" or comma-separated list
4. Click "Run workflow"

## Release Triggers Summary

### Primary: Release Branch
- **Trigger**: Push to `release` branch
- **When**: Ready to release new version
- **Process**: Automatic build → test → publish → tag

### Secondary: Manual Dispatch
- **Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch
- **When**: Emergency releases or testing
- **Process**: Direct release with options

## Package Publishing

### NPM Packages

The following packages are published to NPM:

| Package | Path | Public |
|---------|------|---------|
| @rcs-lang/ast | packages/ast | ✅ |
| @rcs-lang/compiler | packages/compiler | ✅ |
| @rcs-lang/csm | packages/csm | ✅ |
| @rcs-lang/language-service | packages/language-service | ✅ |
| @rcs-lang/cli | apps/cli | ✅ |
| @rcs-lang/parser | packages/parser | ❌ (private) |

### VSCode Extension

- **Name**: rcl-language-support
- **Path**: apps/extension
- **Marketplace**: Visual Studio Code Marketplace
- **Publishing**: Automatic when extension changes

## Version Management

### Synchronized Versioning
All packages share the same version number for simplicity and consistency.

### Version Bump Rules
- **patch** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes
- **minor** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New features
- **major** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes

### Pre-releases
- Format: `1.1.0-beta.0`
- Published with `beta` tag on NPM
- Not published to VSCode marketplace

## Required Secrets

Configure these in GitHub repository settings:

| Secret | Description | Required For |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `NPM_TOKEN` | NPM automation token | Publishing packages |
| `VSCODE_PUBLISH_TOKEN` | VSCode marketplace Personal Access Token | Publishing extension |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Automatically provided | Creating releases |

## Troubleshooting

### Release Please not creating PR
- Ensure commits follow conventional format
- Check if there are releasable changes
- Verify Release Please app has permissions

### Package publish fails
- Check NPM_TOKEN is valid
- Verify package.json is not private
- Ensure version doesn't already exist

### VSCode extension publish fails
- Verify VSCODE_PUBLISH_TOKEN is valid
- Check extension manifest version
- Ensure all required files are built

## Best Practices

1. **Use conventional commits** for automatic versioning
2. **Group related changes** in single PRs
3. **Review Release PRs** before merging
4. **Test locally** before releasing
5. **Document breaking changes** clearly
6. **Use pre-releases** for testing major changes

## Rollback Procedure

If a release has issues:

1. **Revert the release commit** on main
2. **Deprecate bad NPM versions**: `npm deprecate @rcs-lang/package@version "Contains critical bug"`
3. **Create fix** and release patch version
4. **Update release notes** with known issues

## FAQ

### Q: How often should we release?
A: Release when you have meaningful changes. Weekly or bi-weekly is common for active projects.

### Q: Can I release a single package?
A: Yes, use the manual workflow with specific package names.

### Q: How to do a hotfix?
A: Use manual workflow with "patch" type for fastest release.

### Q: What about security releases?
A: Use manual workflow immediately, document in SECURITY.md.
