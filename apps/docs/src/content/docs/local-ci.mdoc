# Running GitHub Actions Locally

This project includes scripts to run GitHub Actions workflows locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).

## Prerequisites

Install act:
```bash
# macOS
brew install act

# Linux
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Windows (via Chocolatey)
choco install act-cli
```

## Available Scripts

Run these from the root directory:

```bash
# List all available workflows
npm run act:list

# Run the main CI workflow
npm run act:ci

# Simulate a push event (runs workflows triggered by push)
npm run act:push

# Simulate a pull request event
npm run act:pr

# Run with custom options
npm run act -- [options]
```

## Common Use Cases

### Test CI Before Pushing
```bash
npm run act:ci
```

### Debug a Specific Job
```bash
npm run act -- -j test -W .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### Use a Different Runner Image
```bash
npm run act -- --platform ubuntu-latest=nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:22.04
```

## Notes

- Act uses Docker to simulate GitHub Actions runners
- Some GitHub-specific features may not work locally (like secrets)
- For secrets, create a `.secrets` file in the root (gitignored)
- Moon is installed as part of the workflow steps
